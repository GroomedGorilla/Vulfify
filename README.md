## Vulfify /// go VULF yourself /// a web app
HTML/JS app to "Vulfify" someone using their image 

## Background
[Vulfpeck](http://vulfpeck.com) is an American funk band known for their eccentric projects that are often the brainchild of bandleader Jack Stratton.  Their projects also emphasize collaboration with other artists (See [Antwaun Stanley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiiWR6436Eg)) and "entities" (see [Goodhertz](https://goodhertz.co/vulf-comp) and [OH no Type Co](https://medium.com/@ohno/the-process-of-vulf-mono-e29b3971a014#.9vmpcsby1)).  

Stratton of Vulfpeck even collaborated on the web app [Funklet](http://funklet.com) with Rob Stenson of [Goodhertz](https://goodhertz.co)

## What we want to build
The idea to create an app to "vulfify" oneselfe came from browsing the Facebook fangroup the ["Vulfpack"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1668975940044050/).  One user posted a request for people to post their "vulf" images that mimic the thumbnails Vulf creates for their videos.

These images are best described as newspaper clippings (the subject---we'll just call it the clipping for future reference) on a colored background

Example img:

To create an image, users will use the webcam on their device in a supported browser (all I want for Christmas is for Safari to support WebRTC) to capture an image of themselves, and the web app will place their image on the colored background (matching the Vulf style) with an option to repeat the image on top of itself X amount of times like the image below.

Repeated image:
